## [1.1.1] - 2025-01-11

### Fixed
- **PHZ Table Prefixing**: Fixed inconsistent table prefixing in PHZ file conversions
  - Tables with multidimensional arrays now properly receive `phd_` and `mod_` prefixes
  - Resolved data migration failures where tables were created without prefixes
  - Ensured consistent table naming across all PHZ file types
  - Fixed schema creation to properly apply file prefixes to all tables

### Technical Details
- Updated `map_table_schema_with_multidimensional()` method to handle file prefixes
- Fixed index creation to use prefixed table names
- Resolved table mapping inconsistencies between schema creation and data migration
- All 72 tables in PHZ files now have proper prefixes (52 phd_ tables, 21 mod_ tables)

## [1.1.0] - 2025-01-11

### Added
- **Multidimensional Array Support**: Advanced handling of TopSpeed multidimensional arrays
  - Automatic detection of single-field arrays (e.g., 96-byte fields with multiple elements)
  - Automatic detection of multi-field arrays (e.g., PROD1, PROD2, PROD3 fields)
  - JSON storage in SQLite for array data
  - Support for all TopSpeed data types in arrays (DOUBLE, BYTE, STRING, etc.)
- **Data Type Preservation**: Enhanced data integrity features
  - Distinction between null values and zero values in DOUBLE fields
  - Boolean conversion for BYTE arrays (true/false instead of raw bytes)
  - Proper handling of missing vs. actual zero values
